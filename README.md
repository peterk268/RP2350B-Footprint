# RP2350B PCB Footprint for Altium

### Microcontroller designed by Raspberry Pi in 80 pin QFN package.
Integrated library file can be found in the **Project Outputs** folder.\
Component pins are grouped into top, left, bottom, and right alignment.

I encountered issues importing the KiCAD7 footprint from Raspberry Pi into Altium, so I used the physical specifications from the datasheet with SnapEDA's QFN footprint generator to create a library which includes the 3D body STEP file.\
Please let me know if there are any issues.
